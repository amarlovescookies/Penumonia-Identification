# Penumonia Identification
#### By: Sang Ik Han, Byung Hui Yoon, Philipp Gaissert, and Amar Mohanty
Pneumonia is a deadly disease where the lungs fill with fluid making breathing difficult. Traditionally,
identification of pneumonia requires radiologists to look at chest x-ray scans of patients. We aim to
automate this process using machine learning. In this study, we evaluated DenseNet, LeNet-5, AlexNet,
and custom CNN to classify chest x-ray images from Kaggle. We found that a pre-trained DenseNet
model with transfer learning performed the best with 90.06% accuracy and 92.43% F1 score. Out of the
four models we explored, we found that more complex models tend to perform better if some level of
regularization was applied.
